## Please contribute

We are doing our best to add more useful packages to Hospice. But that's not enough. If you are an author of a nice Vagrant cookbook â€“ you are very welcome to add it's support!

To make this job easier we wrapped packages and patterns into a tiny DSL described below. You can find all the packages located at `/packages` directory and patterns at `/patterns` accordingly. Feel free to add some more and create a shiny pull request!

## DSL Description

It's coming!
